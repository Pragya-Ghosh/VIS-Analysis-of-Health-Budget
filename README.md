# Analysis of the Indian Health Budget (2023-24)

## Overview
This project focuses on the estimated budget allocations to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare for the fiscal year 2023-24. Using a pie chart visualisation, it aims to analyze the distribution of funds across various major heads within the ministry.

## Introduction
The **Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW)** is a ministry under the Government of India, charged with the formulation and implementation of policies and programs to improve the health and well-being of the country's population. It is also responsible for all government programs related to family planning in India. The Ministry comprises the (i) **Department of Health and Family Welfare**, which is responsible for implementing public health schemes and regulating medical education, and the (ii) **Department of Health Research** which is responsible for conducting medical research.

It is important to provide a *clear* and *transparent* representation of the national health budget for the general public. The pie chart is designed to make it easy to understand where the government is prioritizing its spending, helping everyone gain a clearer picture of how financial resources are being allocated to improve public health.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project is titled **“Allocations to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare for 2023-24 (in Rs crore)”**, obtained from Table 7. This is sourced from [PRS Legislative Research](https://prsindia.org/budgets/parliament/demand-for-grants-2023-24-analysis-health-and-family-welfare).

For this project, the data was processed to focus on the estimated budget for 2023-24 (2023-24 BE).

## Tools and Libraries
**Programming Language:** Python
- Pandas: Utilized for data manipulation and preparation.
- Matplotlib: Employed for creating the pie chart visualization.

## Program Code
The program was written in PyCharm. You can access the [Program](Program) file here on GitHub or run the code on Google Colab by clicking on the colab badge below.

## Methodology
A pie chart is plotted to compare the proportions of funds assigned to the Major Heads of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.

Exploding slices are used to highlight smaller budget allocations, and percentage labels are placed on each slice to represent the raw data.

## Observation
- The largest share of the budget goes to the National Health Mission (30.3%), followed by Autonomous Bodies (18.0%).
- The least funded sectors are COVID-19 (0.5%), Family Welfare Schemes (0.5%) and Infrastructure Development for Health Research (0.2%).

## Inference
- The significant allocation to the National Health Mission indicates a strong focus on broad health services and initiatives across the country.
- Also, the substantial portion for Autonomous Bodies suggests a focus on independent institutions that oversee various health-related activities.
- The relatively lower allocation to COVID-19 may indicate a shift in focus post-pandemic or confidence in existing measures.
- The low funding for Family Welfare Schemes suggests a deprioritization of this area.
- Minimal funding for Infrastructure Development for Health Research points to either a lack of immediate prioritization or reliance on other funding sources.

## Conclusion
The pie chart shows us that there is a clear shift towards reinforcing established health programs and expanding operational independence in healthcare.

### Implications for Health Care Professionals
Healthcare professionals can expect enhanced support and resources in areas covered by the National Health Mission, leading to more comprehensive service delivery.

- **Adaptation to Reduced Funding:**
  Professionals involved in COVID-19 management, family welfare, and health research may need to adapt to reduced immediate funding, seek alternative support, or focus on optimizing existing resources.
    
- **Advocacy for Health Research Prioritisation:**
  There should be a push for greater investment in health research to drive innovation and address emerging health challenges effectively.
